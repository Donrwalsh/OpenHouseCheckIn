5/26:
- Installed Cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org/
- nav to folder of project, >pod init
- copypaste into the new podfile:

source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Eureka'

- then run >pod install
- Installed Carthage from https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases
- In the project file >touch Carftile
- chmod +x Cartfile
- Add "github "xmartlabs/Eureka" ~> 3.0" to the Cartfile
- Still in the project file: >git submodule add https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka.git
- Drag the Eureka xcode project into the project view of Xcode
- Added eureka.framework as an embedded binary
--- The instructions for adding Eureka as a dependency caused a lot of problems. Be careful 
with the mixture of github desktop and command line stuff.
